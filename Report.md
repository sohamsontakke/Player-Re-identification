# Report: Player Re-Identification in a Single Camera Feed ðŸŽ¯

## 1. Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a real-time solution for **player re-identification in a single video feed**, simulating a real-world sports analytics challenge. The system must ensure that each player is assigned a unique ID, and that players retain the **same identity** even after temporarily going out of frame.

## 2. Objective

- Input: A 15-second football video (`15sec_input_720p.mp4`)
- Task: Detect and assign unique IDs to players
- Key Requirement: Maintain **consistent player IDs** even after occlusions or exits

---

## 3. Approach and Methodology

### 3.1 Detection

- Used a fine-tuned **YOLOv11 model** trained to detect both players and the ball.
- Only player detections were retained by filtering the correct class ID (class `1`).

### 3.2 Appearance-Based Re-Identification

- Extracted a **color histogram (RGB)** from each detected player's bounding box.
- Normalized the patch size to (64x128) before computing the histogram.
- Used **cosine similarity** to compare histograms.
- If similarity to an existing ID exceeded a threshold, the same ID was reassigned.
- Otherwise, a new ID was generated.

## 4. System Components

- `detector.py`: Loads the YOLO model and performs player detection + histogram extraction
- `reid.py`: Manages the identity assignment using histogram similarity
- `main.py`: Ties detection and re-ID into a real-time video loop

---

## 5. Challenges Encountered

- **Class Filtering**: Initial model mistakenly tracked the ball due to wrong class ID.
- **Occlusion Sensitivity**: Histograms sometimes failed to differentiate players with similar jerseys.
- **Real-time Matching**: Balancing histogram sensitivity and false ID assignments required tuning.
- **Out-of-Frame Players**: If a player re-entered with changed lighting or pose, matching sometimes failed.

## 6. Techniques Tried and Outcomes

| Technique                | Outcome                                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| YOLOv11 detection       | Reliable and fast player detection                       |
| RGB histogram           | Lightweight but less discriminative on similar outfits   |
| Cosine similarity       | Simple, effective, but sensitive to appearance variation |

---

## 7. Improvements with More Time

- Replace RGB histograms with **deep Re-ID embeddings** (e.g. OSNet, ResNet50)
- Save **track histories** (e.g. positions + appearance) to improve re-matching
- Add **temporal smoothing** and Kalman filters for better ID stability
- Train on **team jersey embeddings** to reduce ID flips

---

## 8. Conclusion

The project demonstrates a working real-time player re-identification system using classical vision techniques. It shows that even lightweight appearance matching methods like histograms can be effective when paired with strong detection. While not perfect, it serves as a solid base for more advanced tracking solutions.
